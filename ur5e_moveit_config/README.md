# ur5e_moveit_config

This package contains the MoveIt! configuration files for a simulated UR5e robot. The simulated arm does not have an end effector.

All files were generated using the MoveIt! setup assistant.

Modifications made to these files (from the generated ones) include:
- adding two custom poses to the robot srdf (`ur5e_robot.srdf`)
